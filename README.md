NASA's EOL library is a treasure trove of images
from space taken by astronauts during their missions.  Their database, the &ldquo;Gateway to
Astronaut Photography of Earth&rdquo; records the location and a description of over 600,000 astronaut 
photographs. The database can be queried by location, camera type, date, mission, etc.  Updates
are pushed into the database a few times a week as images are downloaded from the International
Space Station.
