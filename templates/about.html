  <h2>Earth Observatory Library, Recent Image Browser</h2>

  <p>
    <a href=""><acronym title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</acronym>&rsquo;s
    <acronym title="Earth Observatory Library">EOL</acronym> site</a> is a treasure trove of images
    from space taken by astronauts during their missions.  Their database, the &ldquo;Gateway to
    Astronaut Photography of Earth&rdquo; records the location and a description of over 600,000 astronaut 
    photographs. The database can be queried by location, camera type, date, mission, etc.  Updates
    are pushed into the database a few times a week as images are downloaded from the International
    Space Station.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enjoy looking through the recent images, but I don't enjoy
    <acronym title="Earth Observatory Library">EOL</acronym>&rsquo;s outdated interface and only
    being able to see 50 imgaes per page in a single column!

  <h2>How to use the site</h2>
  <p>
    As new images are posted to the database, they will show up on the front page here. The most
    recent 1000 will load as you scroll.
  </p>
  <p>
    I don&rsquo;t own or controll any of the images.  This is not real time data as it usually
    takes a couple of weeks for the images to get posted by NASA.  You'll also notice that
    the images can be very repeditive as the astronauts often set up time lapse photography
    on the station. There might be 100 photos in a row with from the same angle!
